File "Solution_GetLength_LongestIncreasingSubsequence.java" presents the solution to the originally stated problem in HackerRank, namely finding only the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

File "Solution_GetValues_LongestIncreasingSubsequence.java" adds the additional feature of finding the values of the longest increasing subsequence.

Both solutions have a time complexity of (n*log(n)) and apply similar approaches to achieve this.

Yet, there are significant differences in the implementation: the difference between these two solutions does not consist in merely recording the values of the longest increasing subsequence in "Solution_GetValues_LongestIncreasingSubsequence.java" and not recording these values in "Solution_GetLength_LongestIncreasingSubsequence.java".

One algorithm is designed specifically to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence, while the other does so also for the values.

	 * and a helper method for binary search are applied.
	 * 
	 * In array "increasingValues", the current values are placed in increasing
	 * order as we iterate through the original sequence. Upon completion of the
	 * iteration, the number of the occupied slots in this array (value of "length")
	 * is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
	 * 
	 * It should be noted that although the number of the occupied slots in array
	 * "increasingValues" corresponds to the longest increasing subsequence, the
	 * values within these slots do not necessarily represent the longest increasing
	 * subsequence.
	 * 
	 * This is so because new increasing subsequences could be initiated within the
	 * existing slots as we iterate through the original sequence.
	 * 
	 * See "Solution_GetValues_LongestIncreasingSubsequence" in this repository,
	 * that extracts the values of the longest increasing subsequence.
